----------------

Higher tier cog advantages:
It reduces overall stress impact by its factor.

reduction of stress impact will be measured by ratio of cogs
for example:
if 30% of cogs are andesite, and 50% of cogs are brass, and the rest is wood
then: Stress reduction factor = (2)*30% + (1.7)*50% + 1*20%
The network stress will be = (Network Stress)/(Stress reduction factor)

Stress reduction factor when 100% of cogs are following:
wooden(default): impact/1
andesite: impact/2
brass: impact/1.7
copper: impact/1.5
ind.iron: impact/4
